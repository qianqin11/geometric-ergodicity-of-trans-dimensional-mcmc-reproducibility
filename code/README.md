Source code files that contain the core code to implement the method and various utility/auxiliary functions.

Please run `Reproduce.Rmd` to reproduce the figures and tables in the manuscript. Some computationally intensive code chunks are not evaluated by default, but one can enable the evaluation by setting `eval` to `TRUE` at the begining of the code chunks.
